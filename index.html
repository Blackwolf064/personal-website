    <h2>About me:</h2>
    My name is Catherine, this is my fourth year trying to learn coding and as it seems, i'm not giving up!
    <p>I am an introvert, I love to dream and I am a free thinker. So imagine my dreams!<br>I dream of a day where
      everyone is finally free, both the earth and the people, <br>But I also dream about being King of the world hahaha
